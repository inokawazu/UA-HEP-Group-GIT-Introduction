Presentation Plan
========================================

This file explains how we plan to give the presentation

- Start with theoretical intro to git (not github) (Marco) (30min)
- Idea: Markus shows a little project that he does some work on and then I also start contributing and we work together on that project
	- needs to be an easy project, but not too easy
	- should really do something
	- maybe: Have a bug and want a new feature
		- one fixes the bug in one branch
		- another one implements a feature on the other branch
		- merge
